# Hand-Written-Detection
The Data Set we used to build this model is MNIST Data set which consists of 70000 images for training and testing.

And divided the 70000 images in the ration of 8:2 where 80% images are for training the model and 20% images are for testing the model performance

A Model Which can detect the hand written digits written by humans with an accurracy of 98%.
In this model we add an efficent optimizer called Adam which is reason of getting maximum accuracy
